We may ask you to provide or otherwise collect additional information that you provide us, such as, your profile details, physical address, telephone number, pictures and images, business affiliation or other contact details such as, financial information (such as payment method and credit card number) for the purpose of conducting transactions, details about other social networks linked accounts, details about your listed  jobs, purchases, education, profession and expertise, and additional authentication information (such as your government issued ID, passport, or driving license, as permitted by applicable laws and as detailed in our Help Center at <a href=\"https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/verifying-your-identity\">“Verifying Your Identity”</a>. We also collect information about your communications with OGHELP as well as communication with other users of OGHELP. The information we collect may include</p>\n                                <p><li>         <strong>Personal Information:</strong> In the course of using the OGHELP Service (whether as a Client or Service Provider or Agency or Business entity), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.</li></p>\n                                <p><li>         <strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you use the OGHELP Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address.</li></p>\n                                <p><li>         <strong>Identity Verification:</strong> We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings.

We may aggregate information collected from OGHELP registered and non-registered users (“<strong>Users</strong>”). In some cases, we may render Personal Information (generally, email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as “<strong>Hashed Information</strong>.” This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.</li></p>\n                                <p><li>         <strong>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information:</strong> Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name). But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but OGHelp will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</li></p>\n                                <p><li>         <strong>Collection of Third Party Personal Information:</strong> We collect the following personal information from you about your contacts or friends: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a message room.</li></p>\n                                <p> In addition, we collect information while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Site.
