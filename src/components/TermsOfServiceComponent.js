                                <p>We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.</p>

                                <p>If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.</p>

We are bound to follow such instructions.</p>
                                <p>You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Clients through the Website, as well as any processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us on those chargebacks and reversals.</p>

                                <p>We do not operate an escrow service in relation to the Website. OGHelp utilizes a business known as <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> - for the avoidance of doubt this business is separate and there is no connection between terms, conditions, products and services offered on OGHelp and services offered on <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a>. We do however, provide a service on this Website which allows controlled payments to be made with respect to part of our service, called Invoiced Payments.</p>
                                <p>Subject to the User Contract, the <strong>Client</strong> can make a Payment subject to Section 10, which will be locked from the Client&#x27;s Account and cannot be claimed by the <strong>Service Provider</strong> until:</p>

                                <p>If we have not received any instructions or dispute from a <strong>Client</strong> or <strong>Service Provider</strong> in respect of a <strong>Service Provider</strong> Payment Request within six months or any other reasonable length of time after the day that the Payment Request was received and the <strong>Client</strong> has not logged into their Account during that time, the Payment will be unlocked and released to <strong>The Service Provider</strong>.</p>
                                <p><strong>26.          Requirements for Californian Users and Milestone Payments</strong></p>
                                <p>In the state of California, United States of America, Milestone Payments are regarded as regulated escrow activity.</p>
                                <p>This Section deals with and applies to Milestone Payments that are connected to California, i.e. where a User, being a Client or a Service Provider, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of America (“California User” or “California Users”).</p>
                                <p>So that we can continue to serve our California Users, <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> (an independent and separately operated Business) will facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Client and/or Service Provider either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in relation to any Project or Job.</p>
                                <p>Where a California User is a Client or Service Provider in relation to any Project or Job, and a Client seeks to initiate a Payment, the Users will be directed to complete Payments through <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> as a Transaction (‘California Transaction”) in accordance with the <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions. OGHELP will facilitate the transactions through <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> via its services.</p>
                                <p>On completion of the work related to the Payment, the Service Provider will direct OGHELP to disburse the proceeds of the <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> Transaction to the User’s Account utilizing OGHelp services.</p>
                                <p><strong>27.          Accepted Currencies for Milestone Payments and California Users</strong></p>
                                <p><a href="http://oghelp.com/">OGHELP.com</a> currently supports Transactions only in U.S. Dollars. If a Client&#x27;s Payment method is denominated in a currency other than the US Dollars, the client is required to convert those Payments to US Dollar for the Transaction to proceed.</p>
                                <p><strong>28.          Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Clients</strong> and <strong>Service Providers</strong> in a California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct OGHELP to release applicable portions of the Payment in an Escrow Account (each portion, a “Release”) to their Service Provider Escrow Account or in the event of a refund, the Client Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> Terms of Service. The amount of any Release will be delivered to the applicable OGHelp Account in accordance with Service Provider’s or Client’s authorization, as above, these Instructions, and the <a href="http://escrow.com/">Escrow.com</a> Terms of Service and General Escrow Instructions.</p>
                                <p>As used in these Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the following:</p>
                                
                                    1.  <br/>Client clicks to release funds to Service Provider.
                                    2.  <br/>Client does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a Service Provider’s Payment Release request, in which case Service Provider and Client agree that OGHELP is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Service Provider the amount associated in the applicable Payment Release Request in connection with such Release request.
                                    3.  <br/>Service Provider cancels the contract before a Payment Release Request has been released to Client, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Client.
                                    4.  <br/>Client and Service Provider have submitted joint written instructions for a Release to either Service Provider Escrow Account or Client Escrow Account, as applicable.
                                    5.  <br/>Client and Service Provider agree to close the contract without release of funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Client.
                                    6.  <br/>Client or Service Provider has failed to make its Arbitration payment or paid its fair share of the Arbitration costs pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.
                                    7.  <br/>Both Client and Service Provider have failed to timely submit to Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute as such term is defined in the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Client.
                                    8.  <br/>Client or Service Provider has failed timely to respond to an OGHelp Dispute Resolution Service notification as required by the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the User that has participated.
                                    9.  <br/>Client or Service Provider otherwise has failed to comply with the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are to be released to the User that has complied with the Dispute Resolution Service.
                                    10. <br/>Submittal of a final award of an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such award.

                                    12. <br/>OGHelp believes, in our sole discretion, that fraud, non-payment, illegal act, or a violation of OGHelp’s <a href="https://www.oghelp.com/terms">User Agreement</a> has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Client and Service Provider irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to take such actions as OGHelp deems appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.

Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person&#x27;s or party&#x27;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. In addition, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party&#x27;s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other Users.</p>
